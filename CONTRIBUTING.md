# Contributing to the W3C WebExtensions Community Group

This document describes how the WebExtensions Community Group (WECG) works and how interested parties can contribute.

## Code of Conduct

As a W3C Community Group, the WECG operates under the W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct][w3c-code-of-conduct].

## Getting started

Interested in participating? We suggest you start by:

1. Familiarizing yourself with the [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct][w3c-code-of-conduct].
2. [Joining the group][wecg-join] (you will need a [W3C account][w3c-new-account]).
3. Looking through the [open issues][wecg-issues].
4. Joining the [WECG chat room][join-chat].

W3C membership is required because it provides the legal framework that protects the work in this repository.

## Joining Chat

This group uses a [Matrix][matrix-site] room hosted by Mozilla for chat. If you're new to Matrix, we recommend reading Mozilla's [wiki entry on Matrix][moz-wiki-matrix] to get started.

Once you have a Matrix client set up, you can join our room using the below address in your client.

```
#wecg:mozilla.org
```

## How we work

All WECG-related work currently takes place in the [web-extensions repository][wecg-repo] on GitHub.

The issue tracker tracks specific issues and long-running discussions for topics of interest to the members of the WECG.

We meet virtually every other week, with the schedule and past meeting notes listed in [`_minutes/README.md`](_minutes/README.md).
During these meetings, we check in on newly reported issues, existing issues and any other open discussion topics that have been added to the agenda.
After the end of each meeting, its minutes are submitted via a pull request that also links the discussed issues for visibility.

Outside the live meetings, [the chat][join-chat] is available to continue discussions.

We are still working on establishing a process on creating the deliverables as stated in [the charter document](charter.md). Once that process matures, it will be documented here.

## Reporting

Beyond posts needing moderator attention in chat, if you experience any violations to the Code of Conduct by any participant, please contact the Chairs or the W3C Head of Communications ([Coralie Mercier][email-coralie]).

## Proposing an API Change

If you would like to file a feature request or propose an API change, the first
step is likely to [file a new issue](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/issues/new)
to solicit feedback. If there is general support on the issue, the next step is
to write up a full API proposal following the process documented
[here](proposals/proposal_process.md).
