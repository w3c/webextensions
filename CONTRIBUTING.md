# Contributing to the W3C WebExtensions Community Group

This document describes how the WebExtensions Community Group (WECG) works and how interested parties can contribute.

## Code of Conduct

As a W3C Community Group, the WECG operates under the W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct][w3c-code-of-conduct].

## Getting started

Interested in participating? We suggest you start by:

1. Familiarizing yourself with the [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct][w3c-code-of-conduct].
2. [Joining the group][wecg-join] (you will need a [W3C account][w3c-new-account]).
3. Looking through the [open issues][wecg-issues].
4. Joining the [WECG chat room][join-chat].

W3C membership is required because it provides the legal framework that protects the work in this repository.

## Joining Chat

This group uses a [Matrix][matrix-site] room hosted by Mozilla for chat. If you're new to Matrix, we recommend reading Mozilla's [wiki entry on Matrix][moz-wiki-matrix] to get started.

Once you have a Matrix client set up, you can join our room using the below address in your client.

```
#wecg:mozilla.org
```

## How we work

All WECG-related work currently takes place in the [web-extensions repository][wecg-repo] on GitHub. As a new group, we are currently in the process of establishing our conventions.

## Reporting

Beyond posts needing moderator attention in chat, if you experience any violations to the Code of Conduct by any participant, please contact the Chairs or the W3C Head of Communications ([Coralie Mercier][email-coralie]).
