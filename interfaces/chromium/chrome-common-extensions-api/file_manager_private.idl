// fileManagerPrivate API.
// This is a private API used by the file manager on ChromeOS. The API can
// roughly be divided into two parts: functions and events.
//
// Functions: The Functions interface defines a number of privileged operations
// that allow File Manager to execute tasks not available via public APIs. Most
// of the time this is due to the fact that enabling those tasks via public APIs
// would allow malicious applications to either take control of the hardware
// or leak private information about the user. None of these API must be exposed
// in any public services.
//
// Events: The Event interface defines a number of events that are supported
// by the API. These events allow one to register, in JavaScript, a listener
// that is invoked with event's parameters, every time the event is observed
// by the file_manager::EventRouter.
//
// Both the functions and events interface are only available to clients that
// are explicitly granted permission to use the fileManagerPrivate API. This
// API is not available to any client without code reviewed changes
// (eg. via _api_features.json)
//
// CAVEAT: An application A registering as a listener to any events must assume
// that an application B can listen to any events that are destined for A, where
// A and B are any applications that are granted access to fileManagerPrivate.
// For example, if applications A and B listen to onDirectoryChanged events on
// two unique paths, they both receive events about changes in either path. This
// is due to the fact that events are broadcasted to ALL listeners. It is the
// responsibility of the listener to discard events not destined for it. It is
// also the responsibility of all listeners not to log information transmitted
// in those events, as it may record in logs information that is private to a
// given user (e.g., the full paths and name of a given file).  This API is
// designed with the assumption that all users are equal in terms of their
// permission to observe events, call the function interface and access the file
// system of the device. As the API is only used by Chrome OS' File Manager, and
// the File Manager is being used by the user to access their own files, this
// assumption holds true.
//
// The API defined in this file may use W3C Entry object (FileEntry and
// DirectoryEntry). Since these cannot be directly sent or received by the C++
// code, there exists an additional layer, in file_manager_private_internal.idl,
// that provides translation from or to W3C Entry objects.
